There is the model_cgan.ipynb file which contains the code used for training the model

There is Rs_generation.ipynb file which we use for predicting the response spectra of a earthquake giving the required inputs which are Earthquake magnitude , Epicentral Distance , shear Velocity , focal depth and fault mechanism .
